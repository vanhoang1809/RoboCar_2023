  ```
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Feature
The project to control a 4-wheel motor vehicle using L298N and 3-DOF Robotic Arm includes the following features.

The image below describes the functions you can perform on the App to control the vehicle and 3-DOF Robot Arm:
* The number '1' is the function you can use to control the motor.
* The number '2' is the function you can use to control each servo joint of the 3-DOF Robot Arm.
* Red characters:  You can perform functions by pressing and holding the button to increase/decrease to move the vehicle or Robot Arm.
* Blue characters: You can perform functions via pressed once to switch modes (Front Light: Control Servo/Control Motor) or control the opening and closing of Servo 1.

## Usage
To build software and hardware for a successful project, you need:
1. Research documents, datasheet of modules: 
> * Link overview of components in Vietnamese: **[DC-DC Buck Converter LM2596](https://nshopvn.com/product/mach-giam-ap-dc-lm2596-3a/)**, **[L298N Motor Driver](https://nshopvn.com/product/mach-dieu-khien-dong-co-dc-l298n/)**, **[Servo SG90](https://nshopvn.com/product/dong-co-servo-sg90-tower-pro/)**, **[HC-05 Bluetooth](https://nshopvn.com/product/module-thu-phat-bluetooth-hc-05/)**, **[Arduino nano](https://nshopvn.com/product/arduino-nano-v3-0-atmega328p-khong-kem-day-cap-usb/)**, ....
2. Research how to use the Arduino IDE, Fritzing. Arduino Programming [Documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/).
3. You can refer to the source code in /src/.
4. If you want to develop Line Follower Robot (with PID controller), please refer to the following **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3bE3ygJMx8)**.
